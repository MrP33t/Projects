This is simple task manager. You can create tasks, delete them and finish them.

When more tasks are present at the same level progress bar shows for this tasks.

Program saves tasks on close in "C/DailyQuests/quests".

To build it I used A little bit of Swing and paintComponent.
Program is runnable and has thread.
It is running in 60FPS and reads movements of mouse and keyboard.
I created my own Swing components using paintComponent and User Input so they are not perfect.
